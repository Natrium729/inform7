Chapter 1 - Constructing the status line

Vorple status line container is a kind of value. Vorple status line containers are left hand Vorple status line, middle Vorple status line and right hand Vorple status line.

Vorple status line container has some text called content.

[don't change this number directly â€“ internal use only]
The Vorple status line size is a number that varies.

To construct a/-- status line with (column count - number) column/columns:
	if column count > 3 or column count < 0:
		throw Vorple run-time error "Vorple Status Line: status line must have exactly 1, 2 or 3 columns, [column count] requested";
		rule fails;
	if column count is 1:
		now the middle Vorple status line is "[the player's surroundings]";
	otherwise:
		now the left hand Vorple status line is "[the player's surroundings]";
		now the middle Vorple status line is "";
		now the right hand Vorple status line is "[if the scoring option is active][score]/[end if][turn count]";
	now Vorple status line size is column count.

To refresh the status line:
	say "[Vorple status line size]: [content of left hand Vorple status line] - [content of middle Vorple status line] - [content of right hand Vorple status line]";
