Release 3.0
===========

Hyperlinks
----------

 - Fixed a bug that caused linked text to be displayed twice
   in non-Vorple interpreters.



Release 2.5 (2014-05-07)
========================

 - Updated to work with the new I7 release
 - Changed the author's name from "The Vorple Project" to "Juhana Leinonen"
   to conform with Inform 7 extension guidelines, added "Vorple" in front
   of extension names, renamed "Hypertext" to "Hyperlinks" and
   "Core" to just "Vorple"
 - Added the "Vorple Screen Effects" extension
 - Added and fixed examples across the board


Vorple
------

 - Separate checks for new Z-machine 1.2 streams and caching Vorple
   availability (closes #1 in main repo)
 - Removed the Undo Output Control which is now unneeded
 - Reworked the creation and placing content to HTML tags completely.
   The only allowed phrases are now "place an ["element"] element
   [called "name"] [reading "text"]", "display "text" in the element "name""
   and "display "text" in all "name" elements". The "display "text" in the
   element "name"" phrase affects only the last available element.
 - Changed "eval" to "execute JavaScript command/code" and "queue code"
   to "queue JavaScript command/code"
 - Moved transient text to the Screen Effects extension
 - Added phrases to issue commands directly to the parser


Hyperlinks
----------

 - Added a missing full stop at the end of first line which
   prevented the extension from installing correctly
 - Added an option for external links to open in the same window
 - Renamed the phrases to match the new phrasing in the main extension
 - Leaving out the links' text content will default to the link target


Multimedia
----------

 - Replaced documentation about including resources with the current version


Tooltips
--------

 - Added the missing "Z-machine only" directive
 - Renamed the say phrase to match the main extension's new phrases
 - By default tooltips are shown only on the last matching element
 - Phrases to create tooltips that are activated on mouseover
 - The delay for showing the tooltip can be supplied, and the default
   delay is dropped from 3 seconds to nothing.
